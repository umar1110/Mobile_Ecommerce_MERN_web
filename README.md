Hello there,

I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully wrapped up my inaugural MERN Stack projectâ€”a fundamental Ecommerce website specializing in mobile phones. 
The journey took approximately 1.5 months as I conscientiously delved into the documentation of each package before its integration. Here are the Tech, and packages which i used : 

Backend : 

  -> Node.js   
  
  -> ExpressJS (Framework)

  -> Mongo DB (Data Base)

 Backend Packages : 
 
    -> bcryptjs  (Used for password hashing to enhance security)
    
    -> jsonwebtoken (Used to generate web tokens for authentication purposes)
    
    -> nodemailer (Used for sending emails to users)
    
    -> cloudinary (Used to store server-side images)
    
    -> stripe ( Payment gateway (which may i will change) )

    -> Other basic usefull packages like ( dotenv, validator , cookie-parser etc)

Although I didn't focus much on making the frontend look fancy, because i created it without proper design
But,  I made sure it was easy to use and worked well. The tech and packages which i used are:

Frontend : 

  -> Tailwind CSS ( Framework for CSS)
  
  -> ReactJS ( Framework for JS)
  
        -> Redux ( For states management ) 
        
        -> MUI ( Material UI Components )


Packages : 

    -> react-router-dom   (Handles navigation and routing in the frontend. )
    -> redux , react-redux, etc  (Manages and handles the application state efficiently)  
    -> axios ( Facilitates sending requests to the backend and fetching data)
    -> chart.js  (Used for the creation of dynamic charts in the dashboard.)




    
    -> react-alert  (Used for displaying alerts popUps)
    -> react-helmet  ( Manages document head tags for improved SEO) -> Not completed yet
    -> react-js-pagination ( Implements pagination for better content organization) 
    -> react-slider (to make sliders in product details)
    -> web-vitals (Monitors and reports web performance metrics)
